# Bulk Actions for WordPress
Beta version of a WordPress plugin that adds additional bulk actions to the existing posts, users and comments admin screens in WordPress. Relies on the [bulk actions API introduced in WordPress 4.7][1]. This plugin is intended to give the bulk actions API a head start once WordPress 4.7 is launched. As such, I'm hoping some of you will take your time to think about interesting bulk actions, and suggest them by [creating an issue][2] for this repository. Cheers!

> This plugin is available for download in the [WordPress.org plugin repository][3] as well.

### Implemented bulk actions
- Change post type
- Change post visibility status (Public, Password protected, Private)
- Change post featured image
- Change post status
